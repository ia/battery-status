			GNOME Battery Status
	Battery Applet/Indicator for GNOME Power Management


GNOME Battery Status is a project for GNOME, that shows information about
laptop battery state. It has some additional features, so usual icon of
gnome-power-manager can be removed from notification/indicator area.
Battery Status doesn't rely on gnome-power-manager directly, but counting
on presence in system for some useful integration with it.

0. Rationale

gnome-power-manager's icon has got main user interface shortcoming (if its
purpose - to show battery information) - for see exactly battery percentage or
battery lifetime, user should hover mouse to icon, wait couple seconds, and
only then user could see required information (tooltip - the bad way for
getting information in such cases). Such behavior pretty annoying, so
Battery Status' applet hasn't got such behavior and allow to user see
percentage/lifetime/charge time of battery right in panel next to icon.
Also, using gnome-power-manager's icon, user can't direct place, where exactly
battery information should be showing.

/!\ Problems, which has been described above, can be solved
by using battstat-applet (Battery Charge Monitor applet), but it has some
historical architectural disadventages (such as relies on ACPI and HAL) and
user interface problems (such as using non-consistent icons) itself, and by
these reasons this applet has been declared as obsolete, has been deprecated
and removed from set of standart gnome-applets package in such key GNOME Desktop
GNU/Linux distributions as Fedora and Ubuntu (see also this [1] discussion for
more information)

Another impovement - warning message about critical battery charge.
gnome-power-manager supports notifications (via notification-daemon/notify-osd),
and this is very useful. But when user is deep in thoughts about his current
work/task/action/etc, his locus of attention (see [2] for more details)
may just couldn't see notification-like warning about critical low (which very
important if user hasn't get access for power) - it should be message on top of
all windows.

Device information dialog (which has been totaly deprecated in last versions)
from gnome-power-manager's icon has been replaced by battery
status dialog in Battery Status. In "Device Information" dialog all battery
information puts in one non-human-readable heap and this dialog doesn't meet
GNOME HIG requirements partially, but in "Battery Status" dialog battery
information divided by two easy-readable areas - one for battery capacity,
and another for battery charge.

====

1. Installation

Battery Status can be installed from package, or from sources.
For better experience you should re-login after installation.
Packages for Ubuntu can be found in this launchpad repository:
http://launchpad.net/~iaz/+archive/battery-status
Debian/Ubuntu-related source code tree (with debian/ directory for packaging):
bzr co lp:battery-status
non-Debian/Ubuntu source code tree (without debian/ directory):
git clone git://github.com/ia/battery-status.git
Command for installation from sources:
python setup.py install

2. Basic Usage

After adding applet at panel, by default it shows icon only.
From main menu user (by default) can get access to:
 - Battery Status dialog
 - Power Statistics (provided by gnome-power-manager)
 - Show setting
 - Text Size setting
 - CPU frequency scaling (provided by cpufreq-applet)
 - Power Management preferences (provided by gnome-power-manager)
From context menu (by clicking right mouse button at applet) user can get
acces to:
 - Bug Reporting (apport/launchpad integration)
 - GNOME Power Management help
 - About information dialog
 - generic applet-related options (such as Remove, Move, Lock To Panel)

3. Additional settings

Battery Applet uses GConf for settings. All keys can be found in
/apps/battery_status. Description for each key you
can find using gconf-editor.

4. Technical Details

Battery Status written in Python with using:
 - PyGTK - python bindings to GTK library
 - python-appindicator - python bindings to AppIndicator library
 - Bonobo - for integration application in GNOME panel as applet
 - GConf - for keep and manage applet settings
 - UPower/DeviceKit-power - for getting power information
 - D-Bus - for getting power information from DeviceKit-power and update it on changes
